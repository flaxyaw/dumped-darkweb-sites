Monero can also be referred to with its signal XMR.</p> <p class="text-gray-500 mt-2">The best practice is to send Monero not directly from an exchange to the market but to first transfer it to your own wallet. <b>Exchange -&gt; own wallet -&gt; Market</b> This makes sure that the exchange does not know, that you are sending money to a darknet market.</p> <p class="text-white text-center mt-6">PGP - Pretty good privacy</p> <p class="text-gray-500">To
 encrypt sensitive details, we use PGP, it's always recommend to encrypt
 everything yourself and not to rely on anyone else. We have a fail-safe
 for shipping details that will automatically encrypt them if you forget
 to do it yourself, but you should always do it yourself. We have 
tutorials for PGP inside of the forum and the <a class="text-gray-400 hover:text-white" target="_blank" href="httpREDACTED/archewiki">ArcheWiki</a>. </p> <p class="text-gray-500 mt-2"> Its easy to learn PGP and will increase your security greatly. <b>Make a cup of coffee, learn PGP, get comfortable with it.</b></p> <p class="text-white text-center mt-6">Payment systems</p> <p class="text-gray-500">We
 have two payment systems on Archetyp: A classic wallet where you first 
deposit to the market before you order and a direct pay system, where 
you order and pay afterwards.</p> <p class="text-gray-500 mt-2">Furthermore
 we have Escrow and FE listings. FE means finalize early, this way the 
vendor directly is paid and you are not protected by our escrow. <b>We recommend to always use escrow.</b></p> <p class="text-white text-center mt-6">Support system</p> <p class="text-gray-500">We have a support system and a great support team.

 first deposit to the market should be a couple cents, make sure they 
land here before you deposit more. Deposits are credited after 10 
confirmations, to refresh your balance you can directly visit <a class="text-gray-400 hover:text-white" target="_blank" href="httpREDACTED/wallet">your /wallet</a></p> <p class="text-gray-500 mt-2">If a deposit was not credited and the transaction got over 20 confirmations, you can also use our <b>TXID-Recovery tool.</b>

which will automatically deposit your funds in case they went missing.
